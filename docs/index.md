# Model Bakery: Smart fixtures for better tests

Model Bakery offers you a smart way to create fixtures for testing in Django.

With a simple and powerful API, you can create many objects with a single line of code.

Model Bakery is a rename of the legacy [model_mommy's project](https://pypi.org/project/model_mommy/). This change was made to avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes in technology.
